This file is the todo for almost everything.

[X] Marks finished things, [O] marks things to be done, [I] marks things in progress.

General:
 - [O]I need a catchy name for the framework and for the app that will come from it
      (simply that they can be referenced easily and quickly).

Pre-Documentation:
 - [I]Mockups (menu)
 - [O]Improve on the title page. Should be consistent until the end of my work.
 - [O]Improve the introduction. Especially the URL-jungle. :P
 - [O]Implement corrections from first discussion (Email?)
 - [O]Add mention of easy picture & text rendering (maybe have Renderer supply that?)
