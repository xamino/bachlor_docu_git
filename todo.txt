This file is the todo for almost everything.

[X] Marks finished things, [O] marks things to be done, [I] marks things in progress.

General:
 - [O]I need a catchy name for the framework and for the app that will come from it
      (simply that they can be referenced easily and quickly).

Documentation:
 - [I]Mockups (menu)
 - [O]Improve the introduction. Especially the URL-jungle. :P
 - [O]Add mention of easy picture & text rendering (maybe have Renderer supply that?)
 - [O]Redo all tables so that they show in the list of tables and look professional
     (see: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Tables#Professional_tables)
