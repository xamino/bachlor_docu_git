This paper is the bachelor thesis Tamino Hartmann.
The goal is the development of an Android framework written in Java to allow the detection and usage of printed markers in augmented reality via a device's camera using OpenCV.
To prove the concept, the framework will be implemented into a simple demonstration app.
The work will include documentation for both the framework and the app.
