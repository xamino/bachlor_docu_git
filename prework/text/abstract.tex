\section*{Abstract}

Due to the drastic increase in powerful hardware in mobile devices, it has become possible to move Augmented Reality applications from desktop systems to their mobile counterparts, thus also opening a wide range of new uses and possibilities.
To allow fast development of mobile Augmented Reality applications, we propose and implement a framework that handles the heavy lifting.

This paper describes the path from design to implementation of an augmented reality framework for the mobile Android platform.
The goal is a framework for marker-based tracking and corresponding rendering of three dimensional objects, to be usable in any application for Android.
The framework, called Imagine, will utilize OpenCV for Android for the image processing to detect markers and OpenGL ES 2.0 to render the corresponding 3D objects.
The finished framework is also analyzed for possible improvements and corrections.
