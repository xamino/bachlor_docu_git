This paper represents the proposal of the bachelor thesis for Tamino Hartmann.
The goal is the development of an Android framework written in Java to allow the detection and usage of printed markers in augmented reality via a device's camera.
To prove the concept, the framework will be developed right into a first application that will implement it.
