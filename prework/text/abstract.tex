\section*{Abstract}

This paper describes the path from design to implementation of an augmented reality framework for the mobile Android platform.
The goal is a framework for marker-based tracking and corresponding rendering of 3d objects, to be usable in any application for Android.
The framework, called Imagine, will utilize OpenCV for Android for the image processing to detect markers and OpenGL ES version 2.0 to render the corresponding 3d objects.
The finished framework is also analyzed for possible improvements and corrections.
