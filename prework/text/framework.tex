In this section, we take a close look at the proposed structure and capabilities of the framework's API.
The final implementation will however deviate with a high probability.

\subsection{Proposed Functionality}

The framework shall have two primary capabilities: first, it should enable fast and easy access to the 3d space calculated from the marker.
Second, given a model to display, it should be capable of returning a rendering of the object within the scene.

Generally, the framework shall work like in the following.
Upon import of the framework into the project, the program passes the image to the framework.
This shall be possible to do in two ways: one, let OpenCV read directly from the camera, or two, give the framework the frames from the program manually.
This allows the possibility of using other video or picture streams with the framework\footnote{For example, rendering an object into a video.}.

Now the magic happens; OpenCV calculates the 3d space.
Before passing it on to the framework, the program can read the 3d space.
This direct access to the resulting coordinate space allows a more down-to-earth programming should it be required.
If the program is only interested in the final rendered frame, given a model, the framework then renders the object into the scene and returns the frame to the program.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:sequence_access} shows the proposed outside view of the framework, and where data can be input or read.
As proposed, the framework should offer a wide variety of uses, without being overly complex.

\subsection{Application Interface}

The following represents the suggested interface for the framework.
With the listed methods, all functionality that the framework offers can be accessed.

TODO.

\subsection{TODO, but include: Marker}

	\label{fig:marker_example}
\end{figure}

To enable the framework to detect a 3d coordinate system from a video feed, a marker will be required.
A marker is a visually significant pattern that the system can detect within an image and be used to calculate spatial coordinates. Figure \ref{fig:marker_example} shows an example for such a marker.
