\section*{Gratitude}

The author of this paper would first and foremost like to thank his supervisor Marc Schickler for his support.
Beyond that, general thanks are in order for the author's social support network in keeping him on track and motivated.
This especially includes his parents, Stefan and Katja Hartmann, for proof-reading the text of this paper and his friends for continually reminding him that a deadline was quickly approaching (most persistently Laura Irlinger).

Further thanks are due to the online developer communities surrounding OpenGL ES, Android, and OpenCV for explanations and examples.
Thanks are also due to Linux in general for offering a sane development environment, IntelliJ IDEA for a superior and not frustrating IDE compared to Eclipse, and Texmaker for easy \LaTeX .
