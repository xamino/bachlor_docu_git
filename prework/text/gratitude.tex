\section*{Gratitude}

The author of this paper would first and foremost thank his social support network in keeping him on track and motivated.
This especially includes his parents for proof-reading the text of this paper, his friends for continually reminding him that a deadline was approaching, and his supervisor Marc Schickler for being great to work with.

Further thanks are due to the online developer communities surrounding OpenGL ES, Android, and OpenCV for explanations and examples.
Thanks are also due to Linux in general for offering a sane development environment, IntelliJ IDEA for a superior and not frustrating IDE compared to Eclipse, and Texmaker for easy \LaTeX .

TODO: Still missing some people! Also, make it sound less cheesy!!!

TAMINO TODO: Where do I mention the programs I used beyond the basic libraries I utilized?
