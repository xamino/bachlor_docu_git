This section provides a commentary of the implementation work of the framework.
We will also take a closer look at the performance of the finished framework and where improvements can be made in the future.
To allow our work to be put into perspective, we will also compare the framework with the Aruco framework.

Compared to the feature detection approach, this algorithm can easily manage up to four frames per second.
However, while four is better than two frame per second, it is still somewhat too slow for easy use.
Therefor, we suggested and implemented multitasking to process multiple frames in parallel.
This allows the framework to run with around seven frame per second for one marker.

This low increase may have a few reasons, of which the most likely is probably that OpenCV is currently not multi-
threading capable.
As it does improve performance, we decided to keep it.
