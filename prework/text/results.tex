TODO: Compare with aruco.

As we use the same approach to marker detection and tracking as Aruco, that will be our main comparison.
Aruco manages a framerate of 4 fps for one marker and one object to render.
Our framework manages about 8 fps, although that is possibly only because the device we used is faster.
