Finally we will give a broad overview of the accomplishments of this work, difficulties encountered, possible improvements, and use cases.

\section{Future Possibilities}

While basically completely usable, there are many aspects that can still be improved.
These range from performance considerations, porting Imagine to other platforms, to extending the functionality offered.
In this section, we will propose some aspects that we think could be of interest for future work.

\subsection{Performance}

Concerning the performance of Imagine a lot could still be done, although globally the performance will remain limited by the capabilities of OpenCV for Android.
One of the main aspects that could be tried however is writing the main method that detects markers using OpenCV with native C++ and calling that from the Java environment with a native call.
We did not try that because of two factors: one, a basic Java framework was the primary goal, and two, developing a Java application for Android with native code in C++ is not trivial.
It would also have further divided our attention away from the core functionality, as considerable time would have had to be spent learning and utilizing the native development kit.

We are also confident that some aspects of the OpenCV code could be optimized even further, although that might require a more significant analysis with better and robuster timing features.
The performance of the worker threads when using multithreading could certainly also be improved further, as multithreading is hard to do correctly.

Apart from Imagine, improvements in the runtime environment – Android itself – could yield further speed gains, although normal developers would face a nontrivial task to do so.

Apart from software aspects various hardware considerations could also lead to better performance.
One would be the increase of the speed at which the camera generates preview images, allowing OpenCV to grab these faster for further accessing.
A higher count of CPU cores could also serve to increase the speed by running more worker threads.
A faster CPU than the 1.4 Ghz quadcore used here will probably also increase performance.

\subsection{Features}

Imagine is most obviously lacking a decent rendering system for production use that can fully utilize the OpenGL ES 2.0 framework.
Shading, texturing, and animation would benefit the use-cases greatly.
Features that could easily be implemented for major gain.
Again, these features are nontrivial for us, thus we decided to leave that for future work and concentrate on the core framework first.

Another feature that would make using Imagine easier is implementing either a lookup model for camera values or offering an internal method for generating them.
This would allow the removal of determining these numbers externally into the framework, further abstracting away possible hurdles to using it.

\subsection{Improvements}

From an architectural standpoint, the flow of data within the framework could be solved better.
Especially the transfer of data to and from the worker threads could surely be solved better to remove execution blocks.
Most notably the fetching of input frames could be resolved so that the live preview drawn in the background were independent in speed from the worker threads.

The external application programming interface could be expanded too to allow a better and more detailed control of the inner workings.
Care should be taken to keep the basic simplicity of using the framework though.
Internal states that could be opened to external control include the resolution of the images, rendering settings, and marker properties.

\subsection{Extended Possibilities}

Speaking on a more general view, some extended possibilities for future work offers themselves.
One of the more interesting ones would be the porting of the framework to other platforms, most likely for desktop computers first as they offer significantly more processing power.
Higher graphical fidelity and more features for the rendering side would also become a possibility.

A further possibility would be the harnessing of further OpenCV functionality concerning the adaptability of the output.
This could range from situation aware rendering concerning the lighting of models to detection of further information from objects found in the scene.

\section{Closing Statement}

We have shown our results of implementing a Java framework for Android for marker based detection to be used in augmented reality programs.
This includes preparatory work for the framework and the basic application that utilizes it, to the finished results.
The framework, called Imagine, covers the basic required features to be fully functioning, although various aspects could still be greatly improved and expanded upon.

Apart from the framework, documentation and explanation of its workings have been created.
Documentation is to be found in the Javadoc of the project, also seamlessly accessible by any modern IDE during active development.
This paper highlights the internal functionality of Imagine and how to access it.
Insight into debugging capabilities and possible areas where difficulties might arise are also highlighted.

We have also shown some possibilities for further work that would significantly expand the use-cases of our framework.
To help with future evaluations we have also done some basic benchmarks and timed the currently most processing intensive part – the detection algorithm.
