\section{Future Possibilities}

While basically completely usable, there are many aspects that can still be improved.
These range from performance considerations, porting Imagine to other platforms, to extending the functionality offered.
In this section, we will propose some aspects that we think could be of interest for future work.

\subsection{Performance}

Where we could possibly do something.
Such as writing the Detector in C++.

\subsection{Features}

Features that could easily be implemented for major gain.

\subsection{Improvements}

Things that are currently not so nice.

\subsection{Extended Possibilities}

Porting to other platforms
